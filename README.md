# Informatica Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data from the provided CSV files, Churn_Modelling2.csv and Churn_Modelling3.csv, using Informatica. The project involves various data transformation tasks to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Data Files
1- Churn_Modelling2.csv  
2- Churn_Modelling3.csv
## Tasks
1- Sum of Balances for Male and Female Customers  
    - **Output:** Output file containing the sum of balances for male and female customers.  
2- Number of Active Male and Female Customers  
    - **Output:** Output file containing the number of active male and female customers.  
3- Age Groups Distribution  
    - **Output:** Output tables showing groups of customers based on age distribution:
  - Age between 18 and 30
  - Age between 30 and 45
  - Age greater than 45
        
4- Users with Available Balance Data  
     - **Output:** Output file containing users with available balance data (balance > 0), ranked ascendingly.    
5- Customers with Top 5 Balances    
    - **Output:** Output file containing all information for customers with the top 5 balances.  
6- Highest and Lowest Credit Score Values  
     - **Output:** Output file containing the highest and lowest credit score values.
## Steps to Run the Project
1.Import Data: Import the provided CSV files (Churn_Modelling2.csv and Churn_Modelling3.csv) into Informatica.   
2.Create Mappings: Create mappings in Informatica to perform the required transformations.   
3.Run Workflows: Run the workflows to execute the mappings and generate the output files.   
4.Review Results: Review the output files to see the results of the data analysis.   
## Additional Notes
' Ensure that the mappings are correctly configured to perform the specified tasks. '  
' Validate the output files to ensure that they contain the expected results. '
